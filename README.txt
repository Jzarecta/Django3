# Django 3 course project

## Getting started on a django 3 environment

This project is based on the Djaango 3.0 Full course Tutorial on Youtube done
by Parwiz Forogh. You can see the course on Youtube: Django 3.0 Full Course
for Beginners 2020 |Django Step By Step Tutorials

Additionally I use a virtualenvwrapper environment and added some of the info
about pip and eventually a dockerfile.

## Django 3.0
The project was made with the goal to learn about the new Django 3.0 features
and the modifications over the previous Django versions. It was also coded on
Emacs pony-mode which is something to get more familiarized with the editor and
other tools like github and unittest.

The project is about a django startup page and django-admin configuration.
